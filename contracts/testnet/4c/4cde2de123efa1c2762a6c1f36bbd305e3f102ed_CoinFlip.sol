 * (reentrant) calls to them.
 *
 * Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as
 * `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
 * those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
 * points to them.
 *

 * ********************************************************************************
 * @dev PURPOSE
 *
 * @dev Create VRF V2 requests without the need for subscription management. Rather than creating
 * @dev and funding a VRF V2 subscription, a user can use this wrapper to create one off requests,
 * @dev paying up front rather than at fulfillment.
 *
 * @dev Since the price is determined using the gas price of the request transaction rather than
 * @dev the fulfillment transaction, the wrapper charges an additional premium on callback gas
 * @dev usage, in addition to some extra overhead costs associated with the VRFV2Wrapper contract.
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev USAGE
 *
 * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase. The consumer must be funded
 * @dev with enough LINK to make the request, otherwise requests will revert. To request randomness,
 * @dev call the 'requestRandomness' function with the desired VRF parameters. This function handles
 * @dev paying for the request based on the current pricing.
 *
 * @dev Consumers must implement the fullfillRandomWords function, which will be called during
 * @dev fulfillment with the randomness result.

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
