 code form, you may only do so under a license that complies
 with this license.
 E) The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear all risks of
 using it. The contributors give no express warranties,
 guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer
 rights under your local laws which this license cannot change.
 To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors
