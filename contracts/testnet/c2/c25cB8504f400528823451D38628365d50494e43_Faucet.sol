 and 4, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
 royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution,
 prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute
 its contribution or any derivative works that you create.
 B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license,
 including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,
 each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

 of the contribution in the software.

 3. Conditions and Limitations

 A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights
 to use any contributors’ name, logo, or trademarks.
 B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over
 patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your
 patent license from such contributor is terminated with
 immediate effect.
